DESCRIPTION
    The mail toaster is a collection of open-source software which provides
    a full-featured mail server running on FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Linux. The
    system is built around the qmail mail transport agent, with many
    additions and modifications. Matt Simerson is the primary author and
    maintainer of the toaster. There is an active and friendly community of
    toaster owners which supports the toaster on a mailing list and web
    forum.

    The toaster is built around qmail, a robust mail transfer agent by
    Daniel J. Bernstein, and vpopmail, a virtual domain manager by Inter7
    systems. Matt keeps up with releases of the core software, evaluates
    them, decides when they are stable, and then integrates them into the
    toaster. Matt has also added several patches which add functionality to
    these core programs.

    A complete set of instructions for building a mail toaster are on the
    toaster install page. There is a substantial amount of documentation
    available for the "Mail::Toaster" toaster. Much of it is also readable
    via "perldoc Mail::Toaster", and the subsequent pages. Don't forget to
    read the Install, Configure, and FAQ pages on the web site. If you still
    have questions, there is a Web Forum and mailing list. Both are
    browseable and searchable for your convenience.

METHODS
    all
              toaster_setup.pl -s all

            a special target that tries to build the entire Mail::Toaster
            without any interaction from you. Unlike other targets, it will
            keep right on going when it encounters an error, getting as much
            built as it possibly can. It is presumed that the administrator
            is logging the output for later review. I use this target
            primarily in testing.
