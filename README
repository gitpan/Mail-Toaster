SYNOPSIS
    Everything you need to turn a computer into a secure, full-featured,
    high-performance mail server.

DESCRIPTION
    The mail toaster is a collection of open-source software which provides
    a full-featured mail server running on FreeBSD and MacOS X. The system
    is built around the qmail mail transport agent, with many additions and
    modifications. Matt Simerson is the primary author and maintainer of the
    toaster. There is an active and friendly community of toaster owners
    which supports the toaster on a mailing list and web forum.

    The toaster is built around qmail, a robust mail transfer agent by
    Daniel J. Bernstein, and vpopmail, a virtual domain manager by Inter7
    systems. Matt keeps up with releases of the core software, evaluates
    them, decides when they are stable, and then integrates them into the
    toaster. Matt has also added several patches which add functionality to
    these core programs.

    A complete set of instructions for building a mail toaster are on the
    toaster install page. There is a substantial amount of documenation
    available for the "Mail::Toaster" toaster. Much of it is also readable
    via "perldoc Mail::Toaster", and the subsequent pages. Don't forget to
    read the Install, Configure, and FAQ pages on the web site. If you still
    have questions, there is a Web Forum and mailing list. Both are
    browseable and searchable for your convenience.
