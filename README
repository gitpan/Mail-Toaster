NAME
    toaster_setup.pl - Everything you need to build a mail toaster except a
    computer

SYNOPSIS
    To build a great mail system, install FreeBSD (latest stable), and
    follow the directions on the toaster page (see URL below).

DESCRIPTION
    A complete set of instructions for building a mail toaster are on the
    toaster install page. There is actually quite a bit of documenation
    available for the "Matt Style" toaster. Much of it is readable via
    "perldoc Mail::Toaster", and all the subsequent pages. Don't forget to
    read the Install, Configure, and FAQ pages on the web site. If you still
    have questions, the mailing list archives are browseable and searchable
    for your convenience.
