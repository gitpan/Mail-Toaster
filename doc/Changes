    Autoresponder is now installed from ports instead of as a package. As of
    2/21/02 if you update your ports tree and install, you'll get version
    2.02.

    Vpopmail is updated from 5.0 to 5.2. You can simply install 5.2 right
    over top of 5.0 with no consequence.

    Qmailadmin is updated from 1.0 to 1.02. Just install right over the old
    one.

    Courier-IMAP is updated from 1.3.12 to 1.4.2. Adds quota support. Note

    http://members.elysium.pl/brush/qmail-smtpd-auth/

    Changed Apache build to statically include mod_ssl, mod_php, & mod_perl.
    Mod perl fails when loaded dynamically and after toiling for many hours,
    I gave up and compiled it statically. I learned many others before me
    had gone down that road and failed as well.

1.7
    MySQL authentication, SMTP tarpitting, & SMTP-AUTH support.

1.6
    SMTP relay table is entirely contained in a MySQL table. Previously the
    tcp.smtp.cdb file was still generated based upon the contents of a MySQL
    table. We have modified the tcpserver application to check a MySQL table
    (instead of a flat file) for each SMTP session to determine if a user's
    IP can relay or not. If the database connection fails, we allow the SMTP
    session anyway but don't allow relaying. Invoke tcpserver with the -S
    flag to utilize the new feature.
