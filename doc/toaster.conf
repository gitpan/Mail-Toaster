NAME
    toaster.conf - Configuration file for Mail::Toaster

SYNOPSIS
    man pages for options in toaster.conf

DESCRIPTION
    toaster.conf - This document provides details on what all them nifty
    settings do.

    A current copy of toaster.conf is posted on the Mail::Toaster web site
    at http://www.tnpi.biz/internet/mail/toaster/etc/toaster.conf

  SITE SETTINGS
      ######################################
      #            TOASTER
      ######################################

      toaster_http_base              = /usr/local/www

    This sets your apache root. Note that this isn't your document root--
    the toaster expects to find directories called "data" and "cgi-bin"
    inside this directory. "data" is your document root. This is the default
    layout for Apache on FreeBSD; only change this if you use a different
    web server or a non-standard file layout.

      system_config_dir              = /usr/local/etc

    This is where the toaster will install its other config files, such as
    isoqlog.conf, rrdutil.conf, clamav.conf, etc. The default is correct for
    FreeBSD systems.

      #######################################
      #         Mail::Toaster::CGI          #
      #######################################

    This section controls the layout and wording of the toaster's home page,
    index.cgi.

     web_logo_url        = /images/logo.jpg
     web_logo_alt_text   = example.com logo
     web_heading_text    = Mail Center
     web_instructions    = Fill in the account info and click go

    This first block of options lets you set a few elements that will be
    included on the toaster's home page. The web_logo_url allows you to do
    some easy branding of your login page. More extensive changes can be
    made by editing the index.tmpl file in your web document root.

    The toaster's home page will display buttons for several programs-- most
    toasters will include, at minimum, a webmail program and qmailadmin. You
    have the option to include two webmail programs and three statistics
    programs. Each program has a block of options in the config file. Since
    all the blocks are the same, I'll go through only one example in depth.

     web_sqwebmail                   = 1

    Do you want a button for sqwebmail to appear on your toaster's home
    page? If not, set this to 0. (Some people may wish to turn off some of
    these programs for support or administrative reasons).

     web_sqwebmail_host              = 0       # 0 | FQDN

    Do you require a specific hostname for sqwebmail? If your toaster
    answers to many hostnames, but only one of them has an SSL certificate,
    then you might want to set this option. Otherwise, the sqwebmail button
    will just use the hostname through which the homepage is accessed.

     web_sqwebmail_url               = /cgi-bin/sqwebmail

    The location of sqwebmail within your toaster_http_base directory.

     web_sqwebmail_require_ssl       = 1

    The default is the best choice-- SSL security provides your users with
    security for their email, but more importantly for their username and
    password.

    If you don't have an SSL certificate for your toaster, or you want to
    give your users the option to use SSL or not use it, then turn this off.

     web_sqwebmail_name              = Sqwebmail:

    What should the name of Sqwebmail be on the toaster's home page? Perhaps
    you've decided to call your implementation of Sqwebmail "Funky Fresh
    Mail" on the theory that "Sqwebmail" is impossible to pronounce.

     web_sqwebmail_description       = a fast, capable web mail

    This is the description that appears next to the program name on your
    toaster's home page.

    That's the end of the Sqwebmail configuration. It's followed by
    identical blocks for squirrelmail, qmailadmin, rrdutil, isoqlog, and
    qss. As more web-based programs are added to the toaster, they'll be
    added here.

     web_squirrelmail                = 1
     web_squirrelmail_host           = 0
     web_squirrelmail_url            = /squirrelmail/src/redirect.php
     web_squirrelmail_require_ssl    = 1
     web_squirrelmail_name           = Squirrelmail:
     web_squirrelmail_description    = attractive, many features, customizable

     web_qmailadmin                  = 1
     web_qmailadmin_host             = 0
     web_qmailadmin_url              = /cgi-bin/qmailadmin
     web_qmailadmin_require_ssl      = 1
     web_qmailadmin_name             = Qmailadmin:
     web_qmailadmin_description      = modify your mail settings

     web_rrdutil                     = 1
     web_rrdutil_host                = 0
     web_rrdutil_url                 = /cgi-bin/rrdutil.cgi
     web_rrdutil_require_ssl         = 0
     web_rrdutil_name                = RRDutil:
     web_rrdutil_description         = mail server activity

     web_isoqlog                     = 1
     web_isoqlog_host                = 0
     web_isoqlog_url                 = /isoqlog/
     web_isoqlog_require_ssl         = 0
     web_isoqlog_name                = Isoqlog:
     web_isoqlog_description         = detailed message statistics
 
     web_qs_stat                     = 1
     web_qs_stat_host                = 0
     web_qs_stat_url                 = /qss/index.php
     web_qs_stat_require_ssl         = 0
     web_qs_stat_name                = Qmail Scanner Stats:
     web_qs_stat_description         = Virus blocks
 
     #######################################
     #         Mail::Toaster::Logs         #
     #######################################

    This section lets you configure the logging behavior on your toaster.
    This section is used primarily by the maillogs script. Note that there
    are also settings which affect logs in toaster-watcher.conf

     logs_base         = /var/log/mail

    If you store your logs somewhere else, change this. (Some people prefer
    /var/log/qmail, following "Life with Qmail")

     logs_supervise    = /var/qmail/supervise

    The location of your supervise directory. The supervise directory
    contains control files for all supervised services available on your
    machine, even if they aren't running.

    THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUPERVISE AND SERVICE DIRS

    The supervise directory is where all the control files are created and
    where they'll live forever and ever, even if they aren't used. The
    supervise directory can be the same as the service directory, but it
    shouldn't be. Per Dan & LWQ docs, the service directory should exist
    elsewhere. On FreeBSD /var/service is the most appropriate location (man
    hier for details).

    In the service directory you create symlinks to the supervised
    directories you want running.

    A good example of this is that many toaster run courier-imap's pop3
    daemon instead of qmails. Yet, the qmail pop3 daemons supervise
    directory is still build in /var/qmail/supervise but not symlinked in
    /var/service and thus not running. Switching from courier to qmail's is
    typically as easy as:

      pop3 stop 
      rm /usr/local/etc/rc.d/pop3.sh 
      ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/pop3 /var/service 

    It's important to undertand the difference.

     logs_user         = qmaill
     logs_group        = qnofiles

    What user and group should own the toaster logfiles?

     logs_pop3d        = qpop3d  # courier | qpop3d

    The toaster used to use the courier pop3 server; now it uses the qmail
    pop3 server. If you are upgrading an older toaster and wish to continue
    using courier, make sure you change this.

     logs_isoqlog      = 1  # configure isoqlog first!

    Will you process your logs with isoqlog? Make sure you heed the warning
    in the comment-- if you don't configure the isoqlog.conf file, but you
    leave this set to 1, bad things happen. If you haven't gotten around to
    configuring isoqlog, change this to 0 until you do. (MATT says: a
    default isoqlog file is now installed with reasonable defaults). If you
    have more than 50 domains, you'll have to set up a script that
    concatenates rcpthosts and morercpthosts to a new file for isoqlog to
    get its domain list from).

     logs_taifiles     = 1 

    Today's logfiles will be in filenames timestamped in the tai64n format.
    For example, a file called @400000004030ff6b05921044.s was created at
    2004-02-16 12:35:29.093458500. To view these filenames in a human
    readable format, go to your log directory and enter ls | tai64nlocal.

     logs_archive      = 1  

    For example, the SMTP log file for February 14, 2004, is called
    2004/02/14/smtplog.gz, unless you are looking at todays logs. Prior days
    log files are automatically compressed. This directory tree lives inside
    your logs_base directory. If you set this option to 0, old logs are not
    archived-- they are deleted.

     qmailanalog_bin = /usr/local/qmailanalog/bin
 
    The directory to your qmailanalog bin files.

     logs_counters     = counters  

    A directory inside your logs_base directory, which stores the counter
    files used by rrdutil.

     logs_rbl_count    = smtp_rbl.txt
     logs_smtp_count   = smtp_auth.txt
     logs_send_count   = send.txt
     logs_pop3_count   = pop3.txt
     logs_imap_count   = imap.txt
     logs_spam_count   = spam.txt
     logs_virus_count  = virus.txt
     logs_web_count    = webmail.txt

    The names of the counter files in the logs_counters directory.

     #######################################
     #       Mail::Toaster::Admin          #
     #######################################

    Many of the options in this section relate to to the mailadmin script,
    which the toaster installs in /usr/local/sbin. This script used to be
    called maildomain. The script serves several purposes.

    Its primary function is to act as the layer of abstraction between a
    Mail::Toaster cluster and a provisioning system. The provisioning system
    has defined set of parameters it calls mailadmin with and mailadmin does
    what's necessary to make changes to the mail cluster.

    Its secondary function is to act as an interface for support staff to
    make (limited) changes to the mail cluster. There are tiered support
    levels so you can allow different classes of support agents abilities as
    their needs and skills permit.

     admin_update           = /usr/local/sbin/update

    This script is used by the update function of the mailadmin script,
    which is not yet implemented in the toaster. The update script is a
    wrapper for securely copying files from the cluster master to the slaves
    using a standard file distribution mechanism (rdist, rsync, etc). It
    required manual configuration at this time and is only available when
    Matt installs your cluster of toasters.

     admin_home             = /usr/home 
     admin_quotafs          = /home    

    Where home directories live on your system. If you don't have a
    quota-enabled file system, there's no harm in leaving admin_qutoafs at
    the default setting. This is only critical when you have multiple file
    servers in your cluster.

     admin_qmailpath        = /var/qmail  # where qmail is installed

    The location of qmail. Think twice about changing this, as you'll be
    creating a very non-standard qmail installation.

     admin_qmailadminlimits = /var/qmail/control/.qmailadmin-limits

    The location of your qmailadmin-limits template file. This is
    depreciated now as vpopmail and qmailadmin limits are now stored in
    MySQL and a default template is now included in ~vpopmail/etc.

     admin_adminhost        = matt.cadillac.net   # the "master" 
     admin_fileservers      = matt                # file servers
     admin_mailservers      = mail1 mail2 mail3 mail4 mail5

    On a typical toaster, all three of these will contain the same hostname,
    the name of the toaster. As you scale your toaster up, you can create a
    cluster of multiple servers.

    In a cluster, you will have one "admin" server (ie, the place you go to
    make changes), as many file servers as are necessary to handle the
    expected disk i/o, and enough front end mail servers to hand the CPU
    load required to service web/pop3/imap/smtp sessions.

     admin_vpopbin          = /usr/local/vpopmail/bin

    This is the directory where your vpopmail programs are installed.

     singleuid           = vpopmail

    In the default configuration of the toaster, this option should be set
    to "vpopmail", the user that will own the mail domains. Other
    configurations are possible; you can have domains be owned by specific
    system users.

     create_sys_user     = 0 

    By default, when in single uid mode this script won't create a new
    system user. This flag overrides that. (y/n). If you depend on file
    system quotas to enforce limits on customers (say Joe Customer has 6
    domains that all share a 100MB quota), then the only way to accomplish
    that is by creating a system user account and using file system quotas
    to enforce it. This enables that ability.

     homedirtree         = 0

    Using a homedir tree? (/usr/home/a/ab/abcuser instead of
    /usr/home/abcuser)

     homedir_base        = u   # u(ser) | d(omain)

    If using a system user account, where do we put their home dir? IE, is
    it based on user or domain name (u/d)

    On an unmodified FreeBSD system, all home directories are stored in a
    "flat" structure-- they all live in /usr/home. If this is the case on
    your server, homedirtree should be set to 0 and homedir_base should be
    set to u. If you've chosen another system for organizing your home
    directories, set the appropriate options here.

     use_passwords       = 0

    If this option is set, the postmaster password for new domains will be
    placed in the system password file, so the postmaster will have shell
    access to the mail server.

     show_function       = 1

    This enables the "show" function in the mailadmin script.

     vauth               = mysql 

    Where vpopmail stores its auth info (cdb, mysql, ldap). On most
    toasters, this should be set to mysql. If you store user information in
    cdb files or on an LDAP server, change this setting.

     delete_old_archives = 0 

    If the mailadmin script is used to archive deleted domains, this setting
    determines whether the archives should be deleted when the domain is
    restored to service.

     secure_levels       = 1 

    This enables a function in the mailadmin script whereby different users
    have different levels of access to the script. Currently the access
    levels are hard-coded in the script itself, by username.
