     #######################################

    This section lets you configure the logging behavior on your toaster.
    This section is used primarily by the maillogs script. Note that there
    are also settings which affect logs in toaster-watcher.conf

     logs_base         = /var/log/mail

    If you store your logs somewhere else, change this. (Some people prefer
    /var/log/qmail, following "Life with Qmail")

     logs_supervise    = /var/qmail/supervise

    The location of your supervise directory. The supervise directory
    contains control files for all supervised services available on your
    machine, even if they aren't running.

    THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUPERVISE AND SERVICE DIRS

    The supervise directory is where all the control files are created and
    where they'll live forever and ever, even if they aren't used. The
    supervise directory can be the same as the service directory, but it
    shouldn't be. Per Dan & LWQ docs, the service directory should exist
    elsewhere. On FreeBSD /var/service is the most appropriate location (man
    hier for details).

    In the service directory you create symlinks to the supervised
    directories you want running.

    A good example of this is that many toaster run courier-imap's pop3
    daemon instead of qmails. Yet, the qmail pop3 daemons supervise
    directory is still build in /var/qmail/supervise but not symlinked in
    /var/service and thus not running. Switching from courier to qmail's is
    typically as easy as:

      pop3 stop 
      rm /usr/local/etc/rc.d/pop3.sh 
      ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/pop3 /var/service 

    It's important to undertand the difference.

     logs_user         = qmaill
     logs_group        = qnofiles

    What user and group should own the toaster logfiles?

     logs_pop3d        = qpop3d  # courier | qpop3d

    The toaster used to use the courier pop3 server; now it uses the qmail
    pop3 server. If you are upgrading an older toaster and wish to continue
    using courier, make sure you change this.

     logs_isoqlog      = 1  # configure isoqlog first!

    Will you process your logs with isoqlog? Make sure you heed the warning
    in the comment-- if you don't configure the isoqlog.conf file, but you
    leave this set to 1, bad things happen. If you haven't gotten around to
    configuring isoqlog, change this to 0 until you do. (MATT says: a
    default isoqlog file is now installed with reasonable defaults). If you
    have more than 50 domains, you'll have to set up a script that
    concatenates rcpthosts and morercpthosts to a new file for isoqlog to
    get its domain list from).

     logs_taifiles     = 1 

    Today's logfiles will be in filenames timestamped in the tai64n format.
    For example, a file called @400000004030ff6b05921044.s was created at
    2004-02-16 12:35:29.093458500. To view these filenames in a human
    readable format, go to your log directory and enter ls | tai64nlocal.

    Be warned, if you disable this option, then qmailanalog processing will
    fail and your nightly qmail activity log will not work as you would hope
    and expect.

     logs_archive      = 1  

    For example, the SMTP log file for February 14, 2004, is called
    2004/02/14/smtplog.gz, unless you are looking at todays logs. Prior days
    log files are automatically compressed. This directory tree lives inside
    your logs_base directory. If you set this option to 0, old logs are not
    archived-- they are deleted.

     qmailanalog_bin = /usr/local/qmailanalog/bin
 
    The directory to your qmailanalog bin files.

     logs_counters     = counters  

    A directory inside your logs_base directory, which stores the counter
    files used by maillogs.

     logs_rbl_count    = smtp_rbl.txt
     logs_smtp_count   = smtp_auth.txt
     logs_send_count   = send.txt
     logs_pop3_count   = pop3.txt
     logs_imap_count   = imap.txt
     logs_spam_count   = spam.txt
     logs_virus_count  = virus.txt
     logs_web_count    = webmail.txt

    The names of the counter files in the logs_counters directory.
