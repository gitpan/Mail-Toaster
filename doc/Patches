  v2.7
    http://www.tnpi.biz/internet/mail/toaster/patches/qmail-1.03-toaster-2.7
    .patch

    Based on Bill Shupp's large qmail patch AND his chkusr mysql patch,
    together and then with a few minor modifications. We use the standard
    qnofiles group for FreeBSD's port based qmail, use a different location
    for mysql libs, and include a bunch more documentation for the patches
    that are included (README.*), and a few minor code tweaks so that the
    make cert targets will work if your qmail is installed somewhere other
    than /var/qmail.

    standard qnofiles group for FreeBSD's port based qmail.
