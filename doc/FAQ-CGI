Where can I see it?
    http://mail.cadillac.net/

Can I edit it?
    The file has an index.tmpl file that comes with it. It's a (almost) pure
    HTML page that you can edit to please your tastes. If you do a good job
    of editing it, drop me a note.

Where do I get it?
    index.cgi is part of the Mail::Toaster package. You can get it from
    here: http://www.tnpi.biz/computing/mail/toaster/Mail-Toaster.tar.gz

Can I use it without the rest of your toaster?
    Yes, you will need still need to install Mail::Toaster and HTML::Parser
    but once that's done, Mail::Toaster::CGI will work for you.

What needs to be done to Apache for use?
    You need to enable the .cgi handler, add index.cgi to the
    DirectoryIndex, and enable ExecCGI on the directory index.cgi is
    installed in. See the contrib directory of the Mail::Toaster
    distribution for a diff (for perusal) and a patch file (to be applied
    against an Apache2 httpd.conf). Here is the diff:

    Reload Apache and you're all set.
