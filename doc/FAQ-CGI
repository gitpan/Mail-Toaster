Where can I see it?
    http://mail.cadillac.net/

Can I edit it?
    The file has a index.tmpl file that comes with it. It's a (almost) pure
    HTML page that you can edit to please your tastes. If you do a good job
    of editing it, drop me a note.

Where do I get it?
    http://www.tnpi.biz/computing/mail/toaster/Mail-Toaster.tar.gz

    It's a component of the Mail::Toaster perl package.

Can I use it without the rest of your toaster?
    Yes, you will need still need to install MATT::Bundle and Mail::Toaster
    but once that's done, Mail::Toaster::CGI will work for you.
