NAME
    toaster_setup.pl - Everything you need to build a mail toaster except a
    computer

SYNOPSIS
    To build a great mail system, install FreeBSD (latest stable), and
    follow the directions on the toaster page (see URL below).

DESCRIPTION
    A complete set of instructions for building a mail toaster are on the
    toaster install page. There is actually quite a bit of documenation
    available for the "Matt Style" toaster. Much of it is within the Perl
    code itself and is thus readable via "perldoc Mail::Toaster", and all
    the subsequent doc pages. Of course, don't forget to read the Install,
    Configure, and FAQ pages on the web site. If you still have questions,
    the mailing list archives are browseable and searchable for your
    convenience. Lastly, there is also a bit of documentation in the
    configuration files.

TODO
            Start up daemons after we install them.
            Check if daemons are running before installs.
            Add checks to pkg_add so that if pkg_add -r fails, install from ports
            Turn entire process into a ./install_it_all script
            Add -s dnscache section to install a DNS stub resolver
