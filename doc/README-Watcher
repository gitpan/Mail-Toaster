NAME
    toaster-watcher.pl - Mail::Toaster::Watcher - monitors aspects of a
    qmail toaster

SYNOPSIS
    At the moment toaster-watcher is two things. First, it's a configuration
    file that stores settings about your mail system. Other scripts and
    programs use this configuration file to determine how to configure
    themselves and other parts of the mail toaster solution.

    The second part is a script that builds the control (run) file for
    qmail-smtpd. It takes into consideration all your settings, tests the
    RBL's you've selected to use, and builds a control file accordingly. It
    will soon be much, much more.

DESCRIPTION
TODO
    Optionally send an email notification to an admin if a file gets
    updated. Make this configurable on a per service basis. I can imagine
    wanting to know if pop3/run or send/run ever changed but I don't care to
    get emailed every time a RBL fails a DNS check.

    Feature request by David Chaplin-Leobell: check for low disk space on
    the queue and mail delivery partitions. If low disk is detected, it
    could either just notify the administrator, or it could do some cleanup
    of things like the qmail-scanner quarantine folder.
