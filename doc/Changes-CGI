     - This changelog is deprecated. All updates since
       v1.6 and going forward are in the main mail::toaster
       changelog.

2003.11.26 - 1.6
     - load HTML::Template via LoadModule instead of "use"
     - reorder main() a bit so "make test" will work
     - added httpd.conf.patch calls to "make conf" targets

2003.11.22 - 1.5
     - Added pod documentation to CGI.pm
     - Removed hard coded host from CGI.pm
     - Added httpd.conf-2.0.patch to contrib
     - Added httpd.conf-2.0.diff to contrib
     - Those files show what you need to do to Apache
       to have it toasterized.
     - Made the contrib/snmpd.conf and rrdutil.conf files
       share the same password. Now it'll work out of the
       box.

2003.11.21 - 1.3
     - Rewrote much of the HTML so that it could be 
       re-written on the fly based on the contents 
       of the toaster.conf file.
     - Wrote the toaster.conf file.
