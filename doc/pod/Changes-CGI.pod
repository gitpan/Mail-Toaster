=head1 2003.11.26 - 1.6

 - load HTML::Template via LoadModule instead of "use"
 - reorder main() a bit so "make test" will work
 - added httpd.conf.patch calls to "make conf" targets

=head1 2003.11.22 - 1.5

 - Added pod documentation to CGI.pm
 - Removed hard coded host from CGI.pm
 - Added httpd.conf-2.0.patch to contrib
 - Added httpd.conf-2.0.diff to contrib
 - Those files show what you need to do to Apache
   to have it toasterized.
 - Made the contrib/snmpd.conf and rrdutil.conf files
   share the same password. Now it'll work out of the
   box.

=head1 2003.11.21 - 1.3

 - Rewrote much of the HTML so that it could be 
   re-written on the fly based on the contents 
   of the toaster.conf file.
 - Wrote the toaster.conf file.
