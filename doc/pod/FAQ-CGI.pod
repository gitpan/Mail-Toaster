=head1 Where can I see it?

http://mail.cadillac.net/


=head1 Can I edit it?

The file has a index.tmpl file that comes with it. It's a (almost) pure HTML page that you can edit to please your tastes. If you do a good job of editing it, drop me a note.


=head1 Where do I get it?

http://www.tnpi.biz/computing/mail/toaster/Mail-Toaster.tar.gz

It's a component of the Mail::Toaster perl package.


=head1 Can I use it without the rest of your toaster?

Yes, you will need still need to install MATT::Bundle and Mail::Toaster but once that's done, Mail::Toaster::CGI will work for you.
