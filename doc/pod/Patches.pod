=head2 v2.7

http://www.tnpi.biz/internet/mail/toaster/patches/qmail-1.03-toaster-2.7.patch

Based on Bill Shupp's large qmail patch AND his chkusr mysql patch, together and then with a few minor modifications. We use the standard qnofiles group for FreeBSD's port based qmail, use a different location for mysql libs, and include a bunch more documentation for the patches that are included (README.*), and a few minor code tweaks so that the make cert targets will work if your qmail is installed somewhere other than /var/qmail.
