=head2 Step 1: Install MATT::Bundle

http://www.tnpi.biz/computing/perl/MATT-Bundle/MATT-Bundle.tar.gz


=head2 Step 2: Install Mail::Toaster

http://www.tnpi.biz/internet/mail/toaster/Mail-Toaster.tar.gz

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	make cgi


=head2 Step 3: Satisfy any dependencies

	./index.cgi

If it has any problems, it'll warn you and you'll be expected to fix them. So far the only known problems are that you didn't install toaster.conf, or HTML::Template isn't installed. The script will offer to fix the latter for you.


=head2 Step 4: Configure Apache

Make a few httpd.conf changes. See the contrib directory for a diff and patch file. The diff shows you the changes, the patch can be applied to a virgin httpd.conf file (patch /usr/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf contrib/httpd.conf-2.0.patch).

Or you can manually edit httpd.conf. Add this line:

	AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

Add "index.cgi" to the line starts with DirectoryIndex

Enable ExecCGI for the directory in which the index.cgi is installed.


=head2 Step 5: Edit Config File

	vi /usr/local/etc/toaster.conf


=head2 Step 6: Contribute

Create some additional help files and sumbit them to <matt@tnpi.biz>. Think of new and exciting ways to make this even better. Buy stuff off my wish list.
