<H3 CLASS="title">Using SSL?</H3>

<p>Using SSL is something we believe in. Normal communications on the Internet are not encrypted
and thus are vulnerable to eavedropping. Just as in real life there are times when confidentiality
is appropriate, so it is with the Internet. One of the most important reasons to use SSL is to 
prevent identity theft. We provide the latest encryption for every service we offer and hope that
you'll use it.</p>

<H3 CLASS="title">What is SSL?</H3>

<P>SSL stands for <STRONG>S</STRONG>ecure <STRONG>S</STRONG>ockets <STRONG>L</STRONG>ayer.  It is a 
method of encrypting communications between a client and a server so that information can be 
securely transmitted across insecure mediums (like the public internet). SSL works based on trust
that browsers and servers share. The trust is in the form of certificates that are digitally
signed by a Certificate Authority that both parties trust.</p>
