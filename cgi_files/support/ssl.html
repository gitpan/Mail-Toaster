<H3 CLASS="title">What is SSL?</H3>

<P>SSL stands for <STRONG>S</STRONG>ecure <STRONG>S</STRONG>ockets <STRONG>L</STRONG>ayer.  It is a 
method of encrypting communications between a client and a server so that information can be 
securely transmitted across insecure mediums (like the public internet). SSL works based on trust
that browsers and servers share. The trust is in the form of certificates that are digitally
signed by a Certificate Authority.</p>

<H3 CLASS="title">Using SSL?</H3>

<p>Using SSL is something we believe in. Normal communications on the Internet are not encrypted
and thus are vulnerable to eavedropping, hijacking, and malicious abuse. Just as in real life 
there are times when confidentiality is appropriate, so it is with the Internet. One of the most 
important reasons to use SSL is to prevent identity theft. We provide the latest encryption for 
every service we offer and hope that you will use it.</p>

<h3 class="title">How do I use SSL?</h3>

<p>Most modern email clients support encrypted connections and using them is as simple as clicking
a button. In Outlook (and Express), go into Tools -&gtn; Accounts and edit the Connection properties.
Look for an option that says SSL, TLS, or Encryption and turn it on. The following ports should 
be selected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>POP3 SSL: 995</li>
  <li>IMAP SSL: 993</li>
  <li>SMTP SSL: 587</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the SMTP setting for your "outgoing" email and don't forget that your outbound email server
does require authentication. </p>
